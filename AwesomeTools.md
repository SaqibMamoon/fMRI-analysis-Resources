: Geometric morphometrics in non-Euclidean shape spaces
Morphomatics is an open-source Python library for (statistical) shape analysis developed within the geometric data analysis and processing research group at Zuse Institute Berlin. It contains prototype implementations of intrinsic manifold-based methods that are highly consistent and avoid the influence of unwanted effects such as bias due to arbitrary choices of coordinates.
