## [Open Brain Consent](https://open-brain-consent.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
The ideology of open and reproducible science makes its ways into various fields of science. Neuroimaging is a driving force today behind many fields of brain sciences. Despite possibly terabytes of neuroimaging data collected for research daily, just a small fraction becomes publicly available. Partially it is because management of neuroimaging data requires to confirm to established legal norms, i.e. addressing the aspect of research participants privacy. Those norms are usually established by institutional review boards (IRB, or otherwise called ethics committees), which are in turn “governed” by national, federal and supra-national regulations.
## [DIPY](https://dipy.org/)

It implements several 3D convolutional models from recent literature, methods for loading and augmenting volumetric data that can be used with any TensorFlow or Keras model, losses and metrics for 3D data, and simple utilities for model training, evaluation, prediction, and transfer learning.
## [tedana](https://tedana.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#)
TE-dependent analysis (tedana)is a Python library for denoising multi-echo functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. tedana originally came about as a part of the ME-ICA pipeline, although it has since diverged. An important distinction is that while the ME-ICA pipeline originally performed both pre-processing and TE-dependent analysis of multi-echo fMRI data, tedana now assumes that you’re working with data which has been previously preprocessed.
## [BrainSpace](https://brainspace.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
