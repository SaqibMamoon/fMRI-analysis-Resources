# Tools and Lectures
## [Graph Deep Learning Lab (Xavier Bresson)](https://graphdeeplearning.github.io/)
"We investigate fundamental techniques in Graph Deep Learning, a new framework that combines graph theory and deep neural networks to tackle complex data domains in physical science, natural language processing, computer vision, and combinatorial optimization."
## [Daniel Daza](https://dfdazac.github.io/)
"I am interested in teaching machines to discover entities and relations in data"

## [python-igraph stable: Graph Visualization Library](https://python.igraph.org/en/stable/index.html)
Python interface of igraph, a fast and open source C library to manipulate and analyze graphs (aka networks). It can be used to:
Create, manipulate, and analyze networks.
Convert graphs from/to networkx, graph-tool and many file formats.
Plot networks using Cairo, matplotlib, and plotly.

## [Prof. Jure Leskovec](http://snap.stanford.edu/people.html)
Research area is applied machine learning for large interconnected systems focusing on modeling complex, richly-labeled relational structures, graphs, and networks for systems at all scales, from interactions of proteins in a cell to interactions between humans in a society. Applications include commonsense reasoning, recommender systems, computational social science, and computational biology with an emphasis on drug discovery.
