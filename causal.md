## [EconML](https://econml.azurewebsites.net/index.html)
EconML is a Python package that applies the power of machine learning techniques to estimate individualized causal responses from observational or experimental data. The suite of estimation methods provided in EconML represents the latest advances in causal machine learning. By incorporating individual machine learning steps into interpretable causal models, these methods improve the reliability of what-if predictions and make causal analysis quicker and easier for a broad set of users.
## [CausalNex](https://causalnex.readthedocs.io/en/0.4.2/index.html)
CausalNex is a Python library that uses Bayesian Networks to combine machine learning and domain expertise for causal reasoning. You can use CausalNex to uncover structural relationships in your data, learn complex distributions, and observe the effect of potential interventions.
## [dodiscover](https://github.com/py-why/dodiscover)
DoDiscover is a Python library for causal discovery (causal structure learning). If one does not have access to a causal graph for their modeling problem, they may use DoDiscover to learn causal structure from their data (e.g., in the form of a graph).
## [causalimpact](https://github.com/WillianFuks/tfcausalimpact)
The algorithm basically fits a Bayesian structural model on past observed data to make predictions on what future data would look like. Past data comprises everything that happened before an intervention (which usually is the changing of a variable as being present or not, such as a marketing campaign that starts to run at a given point). It then compares the counter-factual (predicted) series against what was really observed in order to extract statistical conclusions.
