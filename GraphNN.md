## [python-igraph stable: Graph Visualization Library](https://python.igraph.org/en/stable/index.html)
Python interface of igraph, a fast and open source C library to manipulate and analyze graphs (aka networks). It can be used to:
Create, manipulate, and analyze networks.
Convert graphs from/to networkx, graph-tool and many file formats.
Plot networks using Cairo, matplotlib, and plotly.
