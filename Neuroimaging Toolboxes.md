## [BrainStat : A toolbox for statistical analysis of neuroimaging data](https://brainstat.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html)
BrainStat is a toolbox for the statistical analysis and context decoding of neuroimaging data. It implements both univariate and multivariate linear models and interfaces with the BigBrain Atlas, Allen Human Brain Atlas and Nimare databases. BrainStat flexibly handles common surface, volume, and parcel level data formats, and provides a series of interactive visualization functions. The toolbox has been implemented in both Python and MATLAB, the two most widely adopted programming languages in the neuroimaging and neuroinformatics communities.
